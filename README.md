👋 Hi, I'm Ondrej

I’m a software engineer with a backend mindset who likes understanding how things *actually* work — not just wiring frameworks together
Right now I’m focusing on **TypeScript full-stack development**, while using **Python mostly as a practical tool** for automation, scripts, and experiments
I care a lot about clarity, reasoning, and being able to explain my own code without hiding behind abstractions

🚀 About Me

Learning fewer things properly
Building things from scratch to understand the tradeoffs
Slowing down when something feels hand-wavy
Avoiding tech that looks impressive but collapses under questioning

I’m most comfortable on the backend, but I like full-stack work when it helps me understand the whole system — especially the contract between frontend, backend, and data

🔥 Current Focus

TypeScript backend (Node.js, APIs, async flows)
Different API styles and their tradeoffs
Databases and data modeling (PostgreSQL, Redis)
Understanding system behavior: errors, edge cases, performance
Python for automation, scripts, and internal tools & AI / LLM experiments when they solve a concrete problem

🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend**
TypeScript • Node.js
REST • GraphQL • WebSockets • event-driven patterns
PostgreSQL • Redis

**Frontend**
TypeScript • React • Next.js
(not a master designer, but I care about correctness and contracts)

**Automation / Utilities**
Python • FastAPI (when it makes sense)

**Other**
Docker • GitHub Actions
Cloud fundamentals (AWS / Azure)

🎯 My Direction

I’m aiming for a **backend or backend-leaning full-stack role in TypeScript**
I enjoy focused, low-bureaucracy environments with clear goals and motivated teams
