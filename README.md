👋 Hi, I’m Ondrej

I’m a software engineer with a backend mindset who likes understanding how things *actually* work — not just wiring frameworks together.

Right now I’m focusing on **TypeScript full-stack development**, while using **Python mostly as a practical tool** for automation, scripts, and experiments.

I care a lot about clarity, reasoning, and being able to explain my own code without hiding behind abstractions.

---

## 🚀 About Me

How I tend to work and learn:

- Learning fewer things properly
- Building things from scratch to understand tradeoffs
- Slowing down when something feels hand-wavy
- Avoiding tech that looks impressive but collapses under questioning

I’m most comfortable on the backend, but I like full-stack work when it helps me understand the whole system — especially the **contract between frontend, backend, and data**.

## 🔥 Current Focus

**Backend & System Fundamentals**
- TypeScript backend development (Node.js, async flows)
- API design and behavior
- Error handling, edge cases, performance

**API Styles & Communication**
- REST (resource-oriented, predictable)
- GraphQL (schema-driven)
- WebSockets (real-time, stateful)
- Event-driven patterns (async workflows)

**Data & Persistence**
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Data modeling and consistency

**Automation & Utilities**
- Python for scripts, automation, and internal tools
- AI / LLM experiments when they solve a concrete problem

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- REST • GraphQL • WebSockets • event-driven patterns
- PostgreSQL • Redis

### Frontend
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js  

_Not a designer, but I care about correctness and clean contracts._

### Automation & Tooling
- Python
- FastAPI (when it makes sense)
- Docker
- GitHub Actions

### Cloud
- AWS (fundamentals)
- Azure (fundamentals)

## 🎯 My Direction

I’m aiming for a **backend or backend-leaning full-stack role in TypeScript**.

I enjoy:
- focused environments
- low bureaucracy
- clear goals
- teams that value thinking and code quality
