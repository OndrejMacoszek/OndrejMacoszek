👋 Hi, I'm Ondrej

Software Engineer transitioning into Python Backend + AI Engineering
Focused on building practical, AI-enabled applications and moving toward impactful engineering roles in biotech, medtech, and scientific tech.

🚀 About Me

I’m currently deepening my Python backend skills while learning how to integrate AI (LLMs, embeddings, vector search, RAG) into real applications.
My goal is to apply engineering in meaningful scientific domains where software directly supports research, medicine, or technical innovation.

🔥 Current Focus

Python backend development (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLModel/SQLAlchemy)

AI integration patterns (retrieval pipelines, vector databases, embeddings)

Building clean system architecture: async, testing, logging, queues, Docker

Tools related to biotech data extraction, research processing, and knowledge retrieval

🧪 Active Projects

🔹 AI Knowledge Engine

FastAPI + pgvector → embeddings, semantic search, and LLM chat over personal notes.

🔹 Biotech Research Extractor

Prototype that extracts structured insights from biomedical PDFs using Python + LLMs.

🔹 Backend Systems Demo

Modular Python backend with async tasks, queues, CI, and clean architecture.

(Projects updated continuously as I progress through my structured roadmap.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend:
Python • FastAPI • SQLAlchemy / SQLModel • PostgreSQL

AI/ML:
OpenAI API • Embeddings • Vector Search • pgvector • RAG

Frontend:
React • Next.js • TypeScript

DevOps & Tools:
Docker • GitHub Actions • AWS • Terraform
pytest • ruff • mypy • httpx • Pydantic

🎯 My Direction

Building toward a strong mid-level Python backend role with emphasis on AI-assisted software in:
biotech • medtech • scientific research platforms • robotics-adjacent tech

I enjoy focused, low-bureaucracy environments with clear goals and motivated teams.
